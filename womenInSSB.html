                <h1>Women in the Super Smash Brothers Community</h1>
                <h2>The Overview</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        March - June 2016 <br />
                        Completed for User Research class (HCDE 313) <br />

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        Super Smash Brothers (SSB) is a fighting game series made 
                        up of four different games played both casually and competitively. 
                        There is a community that now surrounds the competitive play of 
                        these games. However, there are less women than men in the community. 
                        I was interested in looking into why women join, stay, and/or avoid 
                        the SSB gaming community in order to determine strategies for 
                        recruitment and retention.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        The lack of women in the SSB community, or any community, hurts 
                        the community because the lack of diversity slows the distribution 
                        of new knowledge and viewpoints. A monotonous community often has 
                        similar viewpoints. Particularly for the SSB community, this results 
                        in sexist behavior and views, and lack of new play styles. The three key 
                        findings throughout all of my research include;
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How women join or learn about the community</li>
                        <li>Retainment of women in the community</li>
                        <li>Sexism in the community</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Women tend to join or learn about the community through others, mainly male 
                        friends or significant others, and recently, through media such as videos, 
                        streams, or smashboards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Women tend to stay in the community because of competitive drive, a love of 
                        the game, and the relationships formed within the community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, women may avoid the community because of the gender ratio and 
                        sexism (e.g. microaggressions, online toxicity, and the stigma of women in gaming).

                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        Over ten weeks I completed three field research sessions, 13 interviews, 
                        and a survey with 50 respondents.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <h3>Field Research</h3>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        I conducted three field research sessions. I attended two club meetings
                        at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/udistrictsmash/?ref=br_rs" 
                        target="_blank">University of Washington Smash club</a> and a regional tournament 
                        called Emerald City.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During these sessions I took notes on my phone and wandered around the event.
                        I took notes and observed for about 30 minutes during a session. After that I 
                        interacted normally with other people at the event, not in a research capacity.
                    </p>

                </section>
                <h3>Interviews</h3>
                <section>
                        <p>
                            For recruitment I used social media, specifically twitter and facebook. 
                            On twitter I contacted a woman who is well known in the SSB community and 
                            she was able to advertise for me. I also used a facebook group that was 
                            dedicated for women, trans, and non binary individuals in the SSB community.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I conducted interviews mainly over skype because individuals were not located in Seattle WA.
                            This allowed me to gain a very diverse group of participants but may have inhibited learnings
                            because of the lack of face to face contact.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because of time constraints, I only analyzed and used 8 of the 13 interviews 
                            I conducted in my interview report.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Survey</h3>
                    <p>
                        I implemented a <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/zG0W5iAqihux3J5V2" target="_blank">survey</a> 
                        via twitter and facebook. Again, the target demographic was women in the SSB community. I asked
                        multiple questions that had developed from my previous research in field observations and interviews.
                        Specifically, I asked about
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How they were introduced to the community</li>
                        <li>What their perceived roles in the community are</li>
                        <li>Why they stay or why the didn't stay in the community</li>
                        <li>What issues with harassment and sexism they face</li>
                        <li>How they perceive women inside and outside of the community</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        I enjoyed this project because of the subject matter. I am, 
                        and have been, a part of multiple gaming communities 
                        including the SSB community. There is a possibility that 
                        I allowed my own bias to come into my research, however, 
                        I attempted to base all of my findings in my observations, 
                        interviews, or surveys. My research was also impacted by the 
                        timeline of a quarter. I would have liked to take more time 
                        to go more in depth in my research, analysis, and findings.
