                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        Individuals with intellectual disabilities can have difficulties with 
                        learning practical skills like activities of daily living, safety, and 
                        schedules or routines. It often falls on the family or caretakers to be 
                        responsible for reminding these individuals to complete tasks and how to 
                        complete tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Those with disabilities often try to pass as “normal” so they can avoid 
                        the stigma of having a disabilities. Those individuals may dislike or 
                        decide not to use technologies that make them stick out.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        I created a mobile phone app that partners with smart home systems to 
                        remind users when and how to complete everyday tasks. These tasks can 
                        include brushing one's teeth, or making the bed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The app allows users to set up events and tasks and link those to smart 
                        home devices in specific rooms that can remind them of those events and 
                        tasks. The app can be used by the individual with intellectual disabilities, 
                        their family members, or their caretakers. An account can also be linked to 
                        others so events and tasks can be shared.
                    </p>
                    <div class= "remind">

                        <img src="remind/screen3.png" alt="event details page" />

                        <img src="remind/screen6.png" alt="task details page" />
                    </div>
                </section>
                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        This project happened in two separate phases. I first conducted ideation and 
                        research for one month (May - June). I then created wireframes and a high 
                        fidelity prototype for 2 months (June - August).
                    </p>
                </section>
                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        This idea came about while taking a Concepts in Human Computer Interaction 
                        class. As a class, we talked about technology for those with disabilities, 
                        but only touched on physical disabilities. I was interested in how technology 
                        might affect those with mental disabilities. I also thought that combining ideas 
                        like ubiquitous computing (the idea that technology is everywhere so it fades 
                        into the background and is just a part of the environment), and the AMBIENTroom 
                        project would enhance technologies for those with mental disabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These two concepts led me to smart home technologies because they are becoming 
                        increasingly popular and they are integrated into the homes or environments of 
                        individuals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to focus on using technology to help those with disabilities gain more 
                        autonomy. Or the ability to gain independence from the environment around them.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <section>
                        <p>
                            I conducted literature research to support my idea. My research includes 
                            sources that talk about;
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What intellectual disabilities are</li>
                            <li>Technology and those with intellectual disabilities</li>
                            <li>Ubiquitous computing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I then looked at other apps for inspiration. I looked at many calendar 
                            and task apps for inspiration on how to lay out the information. My main 
                            inspiration was google calendars because I enjoyed the visual style of the 
                            app and thought that it was simple and straightforward, yet maintained some 
                            sense of style.

                    </section>
                    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                    <section>
                    <div class="column">
                    <p>
                        I created wireframes, or very low fidelity screens, to illustrate what I wanted 
                        the app to contain and how I wanted it to work. I created the screens in adobe XD. 
                        You can see the low fidelity mockup 
                        <a href=”https://xd.adobe.com/view/dc1469c4-eded-4593-5129-07376c69d215-aa25/” target=”_blank”>here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also sketched out what the smart home technologies would look like. 
                        Some interfaces that I imagined reminders would be on included;
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Refrigerator</li>
                        <li>Bathroom Mirror</li>
                        <li>Television</li>
                    </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="remind/sketch1.jpg" alt="" />
                    </div>
                    </section>
                    <h3>High Fidelity Prototype</h3>
                    <section>
                        <p>
                            I then created high fidelity screens. I started by designing the logo 
                            because I wanted to understand what feeling I wanted the app to have. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One thing that was important to me was that the overall feeling of the 
                            app was calming. This resulted in the main colors being blues and purples.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also wanted to focus on the app being accessible to everyone. This 
                            included checking the color contrast for those with color blindness, 
                            making sure the actionable items are large enough and spaced out enough. 
                            Marissa, a co-worker at Lowe’s for the summer, helped me through this process. 
                            It was helpful because I did not know many of the ADA guidelines for app design, 
                            while she did because she had worked on the Lowe’s consumer app.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Marissa also helped me in terms of providing critiques and pushing me to 
                            go further with my app design. In the end, I created screens for the login 
                            and sign-up process, the main list home screen, and event and task detail 
                            pages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also focused on the error states, which is not something I had done before. 
                            This was interesting and brought up new problems that I hadn’t experienced before. 
                            For example, how do I visually display what went wrong so the user isn’t confused.
                        </p>
                        <div class="remind">
                            <img src="remind/error1.png" alt=""/>
                            <img src="remind/error2.png" alt=""/>
                            <img src="remind/error3.png" alt=""/>
                            <img src="remind/error4.png" alt=""/>
                            <img src="remind/error5.png" alt=""/>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        I’m very proud of the project that I made, because of its potential impact for those 
                        with intellectual disabilities. I think that this project has a lot of potential to 
                        be something that is actually useful for users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the future I'd like to user test with people who have intellectual disabilities, 
                        to better understand their needs and concerns. One downfall of this design is that 
                        it was not based off of user research. It was instead, based off of written research 
                        and studies that others had done previously. Doing usability tests in the future would 
                        help to correct any mistakes that were carried over from the research phase.
