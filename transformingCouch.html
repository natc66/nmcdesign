                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        There are many people who live in small living spaces. It 
                        may be because of where they live, for example crowded cities, 
                        or because they are low income and cannot afford larger spaces. 
                        Focusing on those who are low income, it may be difficult for 
                        them to buy multiple pieces of furniture. A current solution for 
                        this is transforming furniture or space saving furniture that 
                        already exists. However, these can often be pricey and hard to 
                        come by.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <section>
                    <div class="column">
                    <p>
                        I created a piece of furniture that can move between a couch and a 
                        table with a bench. The backrest of the couch slides upwards and rests 
                        on the tops of the armrests while the seat of the couch slides out and 
                        becomes a bench. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ability to transform this piece saves space in a room and uses 
                        less materials. This keeps both space used and cost down.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I created three different prototypes to display my ideas, including;

                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <section>
                <p>
                    There were four distinct phases of this project; ideation, 
                    final sketches, a physical model, and a CAD model.
                </p>
                </section>
                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <section>
                    <div class="column">
                    <p>
                        Before starting this project I had been interested in designing 
                        a couch that resembled ocean waves. However, I decided against 
                        this because it did not solve a problem. Transforming furniture 
                        had fascinated me for a long time and I wanted to experiment 
                        with that idea.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <img id="presketch1" src="couch/presketch1.jpg" alt="goals for the project" />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        I focused on a couch and a table because they are both large pieces 
                        of furniture that occupy a lot of space. They are also often found 
                        in the same rooms or rooms that are close to each other. (dining & 
                        living room, kitchen & family room).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I began sketching different ideas about how to create a couch and table 
                        in one. While sketching, I also researched standard measurements of 
                        tables, chairs, and couches to evaluate the feasibility of my ideas.

                <h3>Sketches</h3>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        I hadn't been satisfied with any of my previous ideas. This was 
                        because it would have been very difficult to get the measurements 
                        to work correctly, so that it would be comfortable for the user.
                    </p>
                    <div class="column">
                    <p>
                        After working with the problem more, I came up with the idea to 
                        have the back of the couch slide upwards and rest on the armrests 
                        to create a table. I thought that this idea was promising so I ran with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One problem I ran into with this idea was that in order to have a comfortable 
                        amount of space between the table and the bench, the armrests had to be much 
                        higher than a normal couch. In order to accommodate this increase in height, 
                        I added a ledge where the armrest would usually stop, and then continued the 
                        armrest up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After I had resolved any issues I thought of and decided on a few basic 
                        measurements, I sketched out how the couch and table would look and work. 
                        I used 5 separate drawings to show the progression of the transformation, and 
                        to give different views (front & back). After I had fully sketched the piece 
                        out, I added measurements.

                <h3>Physical Model</h3>
                <section>
                        <p>
                            After completing the detailed sketches, I took a class 
                            about 3D Art & Design. For one of the projects, I created 
                            a model based off of the sketches. I helped with the 
                            construction of the model, however my father did the 
                            majority of the woodwork. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project was made of scrap wood and fabric. Because 
                            the model was created from scraps, we were not able to 
                            use exact measurements. The models measurements were 
                            estimated and based upon the other measurements used 
                            in the model rather than the measurements in the sketches.

                    <h3>CAD Model</h3>
                    <p>
                        After completing model, I later took a class about Computer 
                        Aided Design, specifically focused on the program solidworks. 
                        For my final project, I recreated my transforming couch in 
                        solidworks. I made 8 separate parts including;
                    </p>
                    <div class="column">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Left Arm</li>
                            <li>Right Arm</li>
                            <li>Bench Base</li>
                            <li>Bench Lid</li>
                            <li>Back Bottom Section</li>
                            <li>Back Top Section</li>
                            <li>Hinge</li>
                            <li>Caster Ball</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I then put these pieces into an assembly. There were issues 
                            with having moving parts so I locked the parts in place which 
                            means that the CAD model only shows the couch.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        This was my first design project, so I learned a lot and also 
                        messed up a lot. I found it was a lot more satisfying to solve 
                        a problem rather than just making something beautiful like I 
                        had initially planned. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of the issues I had during the ideation and sketching phase, 
                        I resolved. I started to have more problems during the physical 
                        model and CAD model phases that stemmed from the previous phases 
                        or were caused by limitations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While creating the physical model, I ran into issues concerning 
                        the dovetail joints. The dovetail joints are how the back of the 
                        sofa stays attached to the arms but can still slide up and down. 
                        However, on the physical model, the dovetail joints were very 
                        resistant to sliding. They worked, but not well. I need to come up
                        with an alternative sliding mechanism, however, I have limited 
                        technical knowledge and I did not have access to others knowledge 
                        as I worked alone on this project. In the future I'd like to be 
                        able to consult others with different sets of knowledge. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When creating the CAD model, the measurements I had created during 
                        sketching were not detailed enough to fully define the model. This 
                        was because, when I initially created the sketches, I did not have 
                        the experience to know what measurements were needed and which ones 
                        weren't. This resulted in creating additional measurements when 
                        creating the CAD model. If I were to repeat this project, I'd like 
                        to create all the measurements needed in the initial sketching phase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also a couple issues that I have thought of since completing 
                        the different phases. One of these is that there is the possibility 
                        that the bench will roll out when someone is sitting on it in the 
                        couch position. A solution to this would be to somehow lock it into 
                        place while the piece is a couch.

                        The physical prototype was limited by the material I was working with. 
                        Because it was scrap wood, I didn't have as much control over the 
                        measurements as I would have liked. If I were to do it over, I would 
                        like to have created the model based on the measurements in my sketches.
