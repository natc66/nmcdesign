                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        Eventbrite is a web and mobile platform that allows event 
                        organizers to plan, promote, sell tickets to and organize events,
                        while attendees can explore and purchase tickets to different 
                        events. The company describes itself as an event technology 
                        platform with a mission &quot;to bring the world together through 
                        live experiences&quot;. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our team hypothesized that the majority of users only use 
                        Eventbrite to purchase tickets and do not use the site to 
                        browse events. This detracts from the amount of money 
                        that Eventbrite makes.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        Our team completed usability studies with 8 participants. 
                        We designed the usability study to determine the overall 
                        stickiness of the site, and to determine improvements to 
                        increase the overall stickiness of the site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We found that the use case we had hypothesized about was 
                        correct. Many users only visit Eventbrite after finding 
                        an event they're interested in on a different website. 
                        Other platforms are thought of as easier to browse or more 
                        accessible. The following key findings contribute to these 
                        thoughts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our high severity key findings include the quality of 
                        event content, and the recommended event section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The quality of event content is often lacking because 
                        event organizers present contradictory information in 
                        the description, and add tags that do not represent the 
                        event. The recommended event section presents events 
                        based off of who the event organizer is rather than tags 
                        or similar types of events. To see the recommended event 
                        section, a user is required to scroll to the very bottom 
                        of the last page in the registration process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our medium severity key findings include the limited 
                        filtering capabilities, and the quality of search results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventbrite's filters are lacking when it comes to the 
                        date and price filter. The date filter is presented on 
                        the homepage but is missing the custom date option, so 
                        users do not expect that they are able to filter with a 
                        custom date range on the search results page. The price 
                        filter only offers free and paid filters, rather than a 
                        custom price range. The quality of search results are 
                        often lacking. The search results don't match the user 
                        input, especially with the location filter, where the 
                        location will be set somewhere but results are shown that 
                        are quite a ways away. There is also limited control of 
                        search results. Many users wanted to be able to pick more 
                        than one category to find events, but that is not an option.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over ten weeks our team went through declaring and proposing
                        our project, developing a study plan, conducting usability 
                        testing, analyzing the data, and then wrote our final report 
                        and presented our findings.

                    <h3>Project Declaration &amp; Proposal</h3>
                    <p>
                        Eventbrite is a web and mobile platform that allows event 
                        organizers to plan, promote, sell tickets, and host events,
                        while attendees can explore and purchase tickets to different 
                        events. Our team chose to focus on the web platform and the 
                        attendees. There is more to explore and evaluate on the web 
                        platform and attendees are the users who generate revenue for 
                        Eventbrite by purchasing tickets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Specifically, our team was interested in investigating 
                        the overall stickiness of the site. We wanted to find 
                        whether Eventbrite encourages users to stay on the site 
                        and browse, and what could be done to improve the overall 
                        stickiness of the site.

                    <p>After deciding our focus, we had to create the plan and 
                    test kit for our usability study. This included the recruitment 
                    survey, the scenarios or what we would ask participants to do, 
                    the script for our studies, additional surveys, and questions 
                    we would ask the participants.

                    <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                    <p>Our team tested with eight participants. Seven of the 
                    testing sessions were in private rooms and one was in a quiet 
                    hallway, and all eight were recorded with both audio and video 
                    via <a href="https://uxcloud.us/" target="_blank">UX cloud</a>. 
                    For each testing session, we had at least two of our team there; 
                    one to moderate the test session, and one to take notes. If 
                    there were additional team members available, they would also 
                    take notes.</p>
                    <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our team went through the notes we had recorded during 
                        our testing sessions and extracted the important information. 
                        We had attended three or four testing sessions each, so 
                        we had an idea of what the general trends were and what 
                        information we should pull out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We then took particularly salient quotes or notes and 
                        wrote them out on sticky notes in order to do affinity 
                        analysis. We found trends that were present throughout 
                        all of the eight studies. We wrote our preliminary analysis 
                        based on these trends that we found.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        I believe that we gained valuable results about the 
                        overall stickiness of Eventbrite's website. Some issues 
                        that we ran into included how the team worked together, 
                        and a rushed recruitment timeline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were some issues with how work was delegated within 
                        the team. From the beginning one of my teammates was an 
                        obvious leader within the team. They tended to start 
                        discussions and talk about what we needed to get done. 
                        This ended up backfiring because they and I ended up doing 
                        a large amount of the work and the other two team members 
                        tended to slack off a bit more. After meeting with the 
                        professor to try and work through the issues within our team, 
                        one of the other team members stepped up and took charge of 
                        the final paper, delegating work to everyone else and 
                        editing the final product. However, the third teammate 
                        seemed to still slack off. They attempted to take over the 
                        presentation, their assigned work, near when it was due, 
                        after I had done a lot of the work already. Overall, this 
                        team was not very enjoyable to work in because of the 
                        unbalanced workload and the lack of effort put in by some 
                        team members.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The recruitment timeline was very short. We had about a 
                        week to create our recruitment survey, send it out to the 
                        world, filter through responses, and schedule participants. 
                        There were a lot of unforeseen obstacles within this 
                        recruitment process. For this project, we were not able 
                        to offer any incentives for participants which meant that 
                        people were less likely to want to participate in this 
                        study, and wouldn't fill out the survey, or they wouldn't 
                        respond to our emails after filling out the survey. We 
                        ended up having to somewhat disregard what our initial 
                        recruitment criteria was because we had to have around 
                        7-8 participants total. After we received responses to 
                        our survey, we had to reserve spaces to hold the usability 
                        study session in. However, this was during midterms at 
                        University of Washington and finding private rooms to 
                        reserve proved to be challenging. This further limited 
                        who we could complete usability study sessions with, and 
                        meant that our sessions were not all held in the same area 
                        or room. Although we tried to keep all of our sessions in 
                        private rooms, there was one that was held in a quiet 
                        public area.
