                <section>
                    <p>
                        Students with disabilities at the University of Washington 
                        often download multiple google chrome extensions just to 
                        make websites usable. This is true across a variety of 
                        disabilities and includes adding alternative (alt) text to 
                        images, changing fonts, and screen readers.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <section>
                    <div class="column">
                        <p>
                            Our team created a google chrome extension and API. Together, 
                            these address multiple issues that those with disabilities 
                            experience while on websites. It requires the user to only 
                            download one google chrome extension and pick and choose 
                            which settings, or modifications they wish to utilize.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The google chrome extension allows users to modify 
                            different websites. It currently does not utilize the 
                            settings page and simply addresses all disabilities 
                            at the same time. Some of the aspects of websites it 
                            addresses is;
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Changing the background to white</li>
                            <li>Changing the text to black</li>
                            <li>Changing the text to Verdana</li>
                            <li>Adding more space between lines of text</li>
                            <li>If a paragraph is too long, summarizing it</li>
                            <li>Adding alt text to images without alt text</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The API takes large bodies of text and summarizes 
                            them by using the first, last, and another important 
                            sentence from a paragraph. The API also takes images 
                            without alt text and provides alt text for them using 
                            the Microsoft Vision API.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Over 24 hours our team went through research, ideation, coding, and presenting.

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <section>
                    <div class="column">
                        <p>
                            A friend who works with disabled students suggested we 
                            pursue a project around accessibility. One of the main 
                            issues they brought up was that students were downloading 
                            multiple google chrome extensions just to make websites 
                            usable. We decided that we wanted to create a google 
                            chrome extension that made websites usable for a variety 
                            of different users. However, we weren't sure what made 
                            websites accessible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Specifically, our team was interested in investigating 
                            the overall stickiness of the site. We wanted to find 
                            whether Eventbrite encourages users to stay on the site 
                            and browse, and what could be done to improve the overall 
                            stickiness of the site.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <a href="https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility"

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        We then took this research and created two personas, 
                        Emily Scott a dyslexic high school student, and Addison 
                        Earl a blind college student.

                    <h3>Ideation</h3>
                    <section>
                        <div class="column">
                            <p>
                                We decided that we wanted to create a google chrome extension 
                                because we felt it would be most convenient to our user base. 
                                We also decided that this chrome extension should be able to 
                                address issues for all of the different disabilities. In order 
                                to do this, we decided to create profiles with pre-set 
                                settings for different users based on the research. We 
                                identified which do’s and don’ts from the research we could 
                                address. The other designer and I then moved to sketching 
                                the information flow and the settings page layout while the 
                                developers were working on the API and how to alter the html 
                                of different sites.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After we sketched out the information flow and 
                                had established a basis for the design of the 
                                settings page, we started working on the prototype 
                                in Adobe XD and Adobe Illustrator. We struggled 
                                with color choices for a long time because we were 
                                trying to balance aesthetic with accessibility. 
                                This meant we had to have contrast between the 
                                background and text, no bright colors, and still 
                                have it look nice. We eventually decided on an 
                                orange and kept the color palette simple with only 
                                orange, white, and dark grey. Other than that, most 
                                design choices were simple. We were sure we wanted 
                                large buttons for those with physical disabilities, 
                                and that we wanted short but informational descriptions 
                                for those with dyslexia.

                    <h3>Coding</h3>
                    <p>
                        After completing our prototype, our team moved towards 
                        coding everything and presenting our project. I did not 
                        participate in the coding of our project, and instead 
                        focused on the slide deck, the presentation, the write up, 
                        and submitting our project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The other members of my team worked on finishing the API, 
                        the google chrome extension, and the settings page.

                <section>
                    <p>
                        I enjoyed the topic of this project, and it was interesting 
                        working with developers, as I haven't had much experience 
                        working with other disciplines. In the beginning, Oorja, 
                        the other UX designer, and I had to convince the rest of 
                        our team to start with research and the user, rather than 
                        starting with what technology was interesting. This took 
                        awhile, but when we showed them the research we had found, 
                        they started to understand and got excited.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, the google chrome extension does not utilize 
                        the settings page. Instead, it has all of the settings 
                        turned on, all the time. If we had more time, we'd have 
                        linked the setting page to the program, so users can pick 
                        and choose which modifications they need or don't need.
