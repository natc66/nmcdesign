                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        Parents and elementary school aged children are separated 
                        during most of the day. Children need to focus during 
                        classes and in depth technology can be distracting. Parents 
                        can also be worried about their young children&apos;s exposure 
                        to technology. Talking to a young child and trying to get 
                        specific answers from them, after the school day is done, 
                        can be difficult.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        Our team created a child&apos;s wearable device to be worn on 
                        the wrist, and a partnered mobile application for the 
                        parents or guardians. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We tried to limit the child&apos;s interaction so the child&apos;s 
                        wearable will only be activated when a message is sent to 
                        it, and the responses are limited to 8 emoticons. The 
                        child&apos;s wearable can also be adjusted so it can grow with 
                        the child. The wearable is enabled with GPS, which links 
                        to the phone app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The partnered mobile application starts on the child&apos;s 
                        profile page. This allows parents to view their child&apos;s 
                        location, and data visualizations based on their child&apos;s 
                        messages. The data visualizations are supposed to give 
                        the parents an overview of their child&apos;s emotional well 
                        being.

                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        Over ten weeks our team went through initial research, 
                        ideation, usability testing, high fidelity prototyping, 
                        and a presentation.

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        Each team member interviewed a parent of elementary 
                        or middle school students in order to understand how 
                        parents interact with their children&apos;s education and 
                        how they maintain their relationships. We then compiled 
                        these findings into two personas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our first persona was focused on their child&apos;s 
                        education. For example, how they were doing in school, 
                        who their teacher was, and communication with other 
                        parents. In contrast, our second persona was focused 
                        on their child&apos;s development and well being. For example,
                        their hobbies, their values and morals, and having 
                        conversations with them.

                        <p>
                            Our first persona was focused on their child&apos;s 
                            education. For example, how they were doing in 
                            school, who their teacher was, and communication 
                            with other parents. In contrast, our second persona 
                            was focused on their child&apos;s development and well 
                            being. For example, their hobbies, their values 
                            and morals, and having conversations with them.

                            <p>
                                While talking early on, the idea of a children&apos;s 
                                wearable device to connect parents and children 
                                was brought up. This idea became integral to our 
                                overall design and we decided to add the parent 
                                interaction through a mobile application. We then 
                                experimented with what the wearable would be 
                                capable of doing. We talked about a camera, how 
                                messaging would work, location services, and games. 
                                We ultimately decided that we did not want the 
                                wearable to be distracting and only included 
                                messaging, and location services.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When we were still considering education and 
                                emotional well being, our team talked about using 
                                data visualizations to compare and connect the 
                                two different concepts. The education portion of 
                                the data visualizations disappeared but we wanted 
                                to display the emotional visualizations to help 
                                parents understand how their children were feeling.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Then came the problem of collecting the emotional 
                            data from the children. We decided to implement an 
                            emoji messaging system for a couple reasons;
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Emotions can be easily understood</li>
                            <li>Enables illiterate children to use the product</li>
                            <li>Quick and simple messaging</li>
                            <li>Good use of space on the wearable</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            We created a visualization of our information architecture
                            in order to organize and solidify ou rthoughts and ideas. 
                            This information architecture helped us to develop our 
                            paper prototypes as well.

                    <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our team created paper prototypes of the wearable and 
                        the mobile application in order to have users test our 
                        product. Finding our target user group for usability 
                        testing was much more difficult because of time constraints 
                        and location constraints. Three of our team members tested 
                        on undergraduate students at UW and our other team member 
                        tested on a parent and child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We found that the wearable was easy for the child to use 
                        and understand. However, the mobile application needed 
                        work as the data visualizations did not make sense to 
                        many users, and some of the location based services and 
                        symbols did not make sense to them.

                    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                    <section>
                        <p>
                            In order to outline the structure of our mobile app and
                            wearable, we created wireframes. Our wireframes included
                            the initial registration pages, the child profile page,
                            the location page including location based alarms, and
                            the messaging page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also created user flows. We chose to illustrate setting
                            a location based alarm and sending an ETA message from parent
                            to child. We chose these user journeys because we felt they
                            could be confusing and wanted to explicitly state what these
                            two features are intended to be used for.

                    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                    <section>
                        <div class="column">
                            <p>
                                Our first priority was creating a visual design 
                                style sheet so that we could have consistent fonts 
                                and colors. We created the location page, profile 
                                page, and a rendering of the wearable and then had 
                                our first critique with classmates. The main feedback 
                                we received was;
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Color palette was too childlike and bright</li>
                                <li>Color palette was not cohesive</li>
                                <li>Wearable should be adjustable</li>
                                <li>Data visualizations took up too much space</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                When using this feedback to create our final design, 
                                we left the location page alone and focused on the 
                                color scheme and the profile page. We decided on more 
                                quiet, professional colors and distributed the colors 
                                more evenly throughout the screens. On the profile page, 
                                we adjusted the size of our visualizations so there was 
                                more white space which made it feel more professional 
                                and clean. Finally, we added the option to adjust the

                <section>
                    <p>
                        I really enjoyed this project, both the team and the topic. 
                        I felt as though our team worked and communicated very well 
                        together. The only issue we had was discussing the scope of 
                        the project and whether we wanted to focus on parent and 
                        teacher relationship or the parent and child relationship. 
                        We solved this by thoroughly discussing both sides of the 
                        issue and eventually coming to a decision. If I were to do 
                        this project over again, I would want more time to go more 
                        in depth in research and development. Being able to look 
                        into the child's side of this technology would be helpful, 
                        and being able to look more into secondary research on 
                        technology exposure and the effects on children.
