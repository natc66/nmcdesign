                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        During my <a href="womenInSSB.html" target="_blank">Research 
                        on Women in the Super Smash Brothers Community</a>, I learned that 
                        many women feel uncomfortable on online platforms because of 
                        negative and toxic comments. Specifically, many women pointed 
                        to the popular online streaming platform, Twitch. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The current ways that Twitch deals with negativity and toxicity, 
                        is moderators, and allowing streamers to ban words. Allowing streamers 
                        to ban words on their channels only goes so far and there are a couple 
                        issues with moderators. Moderators are often just friends of the 
                        streamer, and don't have a lot of resources to look at or training. 
                        It's also difficult to keep up when there are a lot of people in the chat.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        I created a bot is able to connect to a Twitch channel and moderate the chat 
                        by monitoring the chat messages and sending them through the google natural 
                        language API. It then stores the information of the user if the message is 
                        determined to be negative. If the user reaches 5, 10, or 15 negative messages, 
                        they are timed out for 10 minutes. If the user reaches 20 negative messages, 
                        they are banned from the channel.

                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        Over one month I went through ideation, coding, and presenting.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Ideation</h3>
                    <p>
                        I learned about sentiment analysis API's during a hackathon I previously attended and 
                        created <a href="myndful.html" target="_blank">Myndful</a>. That got me thinking about 
                        how that could be used to filter out negative comments. I decided I wanted to combine 
                        the google natural language API (sentiment analysis) and the Twitch.tv api.                    
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Coding</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first step was connecting to the Twitch server and receiving data from a specific 
                        channel. One problem I ran into was making sure the channel name was spelled correctly 
                        and had a # in front of the name. This problem stumped me for awhile and I had to ask 
                        a friend for help on identifying the problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second step was connecting to the google natural language API. This proved to be 
                        difficult as I found many different instructions on how to connect. Eventually I 
                        worked out how to connect by using a variety of different instructions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third step was to take the messages from the Twitch channel and feed them 
                        through the natural language API. The problem with this was I had to account 
                        for messages from the server that were not chat messages such as command messages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, I had to send a command to Twitch chat to ban or time out a user. This 
                        was not too difficult as there were many resources online.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        I completed a prototype that had all of the functionalities 
                        which I'm very proud of. I'm not the best at programming and this
                        was my first experience with python. The code is definitely messy
                        and unorganized, but hey! it works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I was to do this project over I would try to have the code be more
                        organized. I'd also want to create all of the functionalities I initially
                        planned on creating. For example, I wanted the bot to be able to private
                        message people to let them know why they were timed out or banned.
                    </p>
