                    <p>
                        Those with mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression, can often have 
                        difficulties finding successful and positive coping strategies or 
                        skills. There are many different strategies out there, for example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Meditation</li>
                        <li>Physical exercise</li>
                        <li>Reading</li>
                        <li>Time with friends and family</li>
                        <li>Sleeping</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>

                        target="_blank">Source</a>.
                        Finding the motivation to search for and utilize these coping strategies can 
                        be difficult for those with mental illnesses and they may need help.

                            Our team created a high fidelity prototype of a phone application that gives 
                            the user a coping strategy every day and tracks their favorite activities as 
                            well as their mood over time. This data can be found in two visualizations as 
                            well as a list of the user's favorite activities. The suggested strategies are 
                            meant to provide motivation for those who have trouble motivating themselves. 
                            The focus of this project was on the idea and the UI design, rather than the 
                            code. You can find the prototype <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/bfda59ba-0e85-4178-8ce0-cf4e1e7dae8b/" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <section>
                    <p>
                        Over 24 hours our team went through ideation, research, sketching, prototyping, and presenting.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Ideation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our team of five, two developers and three designers, decided on the topic of 
                        mental health. We wanted to create a phone app because it seemed to be the most 
                        accessible for users. We were excited about the idea of having tasks for the 
                        users to complete so they would be more motivated, productive, and accomplished.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our first thought was to game-ify a list of tasks that the user could complete 
                        by giving them points. The problem was we weren't sure what to do with the points. 
                        We thought about having a character, either themselves or a pet, that points could 
                        get clothing and accessories for, a health bar for the character, or a "love" bar 
                        if the character was a pet. We also had to be sure that if the user failed to 
                        complete an activity, it wouldn't be detrimental to their mental health and that 
                        we could complete this within the 24 hour time frame.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We realized that we were going overboard with the number of parts, and wouldn't 
                        be able to complete it within the time frame. So we simplified this idea and 
                        decided to have one activity per day, with no game-ification, a way to track 
                        favorite activities, and a way to track the user's mood.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        To determine what different coping strategies we wanted to include, we researched 
                        on a variety of websites. We then decided to split these strategies into three 
                        separate categories; Physical, Mental, and Social.

                            The designers worked on sketching the information flow and the 
                            rough layouts of the screens.

                        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                        <p>
                            After we had finished sketching, all three designers decided on a 
                            style guide. We started with color and then moved to the fonts we 
                            wanted to use. We wanted the app to look happy and inviting, so we 
                            used bright, warm colors.
                        </p>

                                Meanwhile, the two developers were trying to learn how to program 
                                an android application.
                            </p>

                                Two of our designers were working on the Adobe XD prototype. 
                                This included placing the visuals, inputting text, and working 
                                on the layout of the screens. Meanwhile I was creating the 
                                visuals. This included the logo, badges, buttons, and data 
                                visualizations.

                    <p>
                        Overall, this project went well. I believe our team addressed the problem 
                        we set out to solve and worked well together. There was a lot of 
                        collaboration and overlap in what we worked on. However, there were 
                        some difficulties related to technological decisions that lead to 
                        problems throughout this project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our team was made up of two developers and three designers. Neither 
                        of the developers had prior experience with mobile android programming, 
                        which is what we decided to focus on. This lead to the developers having 
                        to learn how to code an android application in 24 hours which did not 
                        happen. It also lead to one of our developers leaving about 6 or 7 hours 
                        into the project. We ended up with a high fidelity prototype on Adobe XD, 
                        and the first, "how are you doing today", screen. Looking back at this, 
                        it would have been much smarter to design around technology that our 
                        developers had prior experience with rather than trying to have them 
                        learn in 24 hours.
